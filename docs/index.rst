NavTools 2021.06
================================================================

NavTools helps with planning, execution and analysis of
simple waypoint-based navigation using rhumb-line routes.
It's suitable for small craft making relatively short passages
where the great circle accuracy isn't critical.

This is focused on Python 3.9.
