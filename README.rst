Run the ``setup.py`` to install the various components.
For details, see http://slott56.github.io/navtools/installation.html.

**Important**. Literate Programming In Use.

    The documentations **is** the source. The code
    starts as ``.rst`` files. The ``.py`` is derived
    from the documentation.
    The `build <http://slott56.github.io/navtools/build.html>`_ documentation
    shows how this works.

Use
====

There are two sample applications that annotate ``.gpx`` or ``.csv``
files. One computes a schedule for arrival at the various waypoints.
The other annotates a historical log with distance and speed.

The more common use case is to import that navigation module
to create your own applications.
